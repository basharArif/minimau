# CMS Implementation Plan: High-Level Overview

This document outlines the high-level strategy for transforming the static content of the Leafloat Robotics website into a dynamic, manageable Content Management System (CMS) using Django. The primary goal is to enable content editors to easily update text, images, and structured data without requiring direct code modifications, while preserving the existing design and layout.

## Core Principles

1.  **Granular Content Blocks**: Break down page content into the smallest reusable units (e.g., individual paragraphs, list items, image-text pairs, call-to-action buttons).
2.  **Flexible Relationships**: Establish clear relationships between content blocks and the pages/sections they belong to.
3.  **Admin-First Approach**: Leverage Django's powerful admin interface for content management, minimizing the need for custom front-end CMS development initially.
4.  **Design Integrity**: Ensure that the dynamic content seamlessly integrates with the existing HTML structure and CSS styling.
5.  **Scalability**: Design models with future expansion in mind (e.g., new page types, blog posts, complex product configurations).

## Phases of Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundational Content Models & Admin Integration

*   **Objective**: Define the core Django models to represent various content types found across the website (e.g., general page sections, products, services, features, timeline events, call-to-actions). Make these models manageable via the Django Admin.
*   **Key Activities**:
    *   Create a new Django app (`cms_content`).
    *   Define detailed Django models for each content type, paying close attention to field types (text, image, URL, rich text) and relationships.
    *   Configure Django Admin for each model, utilizing inlines for related content (e.g., product images within a product, list items within a section).
    *   Initial migration of existing static content into the new database models.

### Phase 2: Dynamic Template Integration

*   **Objective**: Modify existing Django templates (`.html` files) to fetch and display content dynamically from the new CMS models instead of using hardcoded values.
*   **Key Activities**:
    *   Update `pages/views.py` to query the new CMS models and pass data to templates.
    *   Refactor `templates/pages/*.html` to use Django template tags to iterate over model instances and display their attributes.
    *   Implement conditional rendering for optional content blocks.
    *   Ensure all static image paths are replaced with dynamic image URLs from the models.

### Phase 3: Advanced Content Management Features

*   **Objective**: Enhance the content editing experience and improve website functionality.
*   **Key Activities**:
    *   Integrate a rich text editor (e.g., CKEditor, TinyMCE) for `TextField` fields in the Django Admin.
    *   Implement SEO-specific fields (meta titles, descriptions) for key content types.
    *   Explore image optimization and management solutions (e.g., `django-imagekit`).
    *   Automate slug generation for cleaner URLs.

### Phase 4: Specialized Content (e.g., Blog/News)

*   **Objective**: Introduce more complex content types with their own specific structures and display logic.
*   **Key Activities**:
    *   Define models for blog posts, categories, and tags.
    *   Develop dedicated views and templates for blog listing and detail pages.
    *   Implement commenting systems or other interactive features if required.

## Documentation Strategy

All planning and implementation details will be thoroughly documented in the `docs/` directory. This includes:
*   `cms_plan.md`: This high-level overview.
*   `cms_models.md`: Detailed model definitions, including field types, relationships, and rationale.
*   `cms_implementation_steps.md`: A step-by-step guide for code changes.
*   `cms_content_population.md`: Instructions for populating content.
*   `cms_future_considerations.md`: Notes on future enhancements.

This structured approach will ensure a clear path forward, maintain design consistency, and provide a robust foundation for future content management.
